1.  man -k WORD
    in which WORD is the specific word we search for.
    This was found by reading through the man manual through the command 'man man'.

2.  mv located at /usr/bin/mv
    sh located at /usr/bin/sh
    I used the shell commands learned in discussion:
        which mv
        which sh

3. find . -name '?r' -executable
    Started with command 'man -k search' which I scanned and found the 'find' command. 
    Read documentation on 'find' using 'man find' and searched how to specify my search 
    based on the requirements of two characters long and ending in 'r', using additional
    information about regex to make the search.

4.  emacs-24.3 is actually executed, after following the symbolic links starting from /usr/bin/emacs 
    I used the commands.
        ls -l /usr/bin/emacs
        ls -l /etc/alternatives/emacs
        ls -l /usr/bin/emacs-24.3

5.  /usr/bin/gcc is version 4.8.5
    gcc is version  8.2.0
    They are different programs with different version dates because they are different files
    that live in different directories and hence have different paths. When I type the command
    'which gcc' and 'which /usr/bin/gcc', the outputs are different.

6.  From reading documentation for chmod (man chmod) and discussion slides, I found that:
    For u+sx, the 's' gives the user temporary owner/root permissions if required on execution. 
    The 'x' gives the user permission to execute the file.
    For o-w, the -'w' removes other (non-owner) users' permission to write to the file.

7.  find /usr/local/cs -mtime -28
    Finds within that folder the files modified within the last four days (28 days).

8.  find /usr/bin -type l >> line_count.txt
    wc -l line_count.txt
    I am on server 07 and I appended the text file line_count.txt. I then count the number of lines
    in the line_count.txt file, which is the number of symbolic link files found.

9. librom1394.so.0.3.0 is the oldest file. The file is 5 years, 12 days old since it was last changed Dec 28, 2013. 
    I used the command: ls -l -a -t /usr/lib64
        -l = long list
        -a = lists all files including hidden files
        -t = lists files in order of modification time

10. From reading about locale (man locale), I see that locale gets its data from environment variables 
    that control the locale. The manual also led me explore further (man 7 locale) and find that LOCPATH
    is the variable for the paths to locale data files, and '/usr/lib/locale' is the default path for individual
    locale data files. I couldn't find anything from 'echo $LOCPATH' so the location of locale's data is 
    /usr/lib/locale.

11. downcase-dwim
    downcase-region
    downcase-word
    I searched in emacs for commands that include the word 'downcase':
        emacs
        C-h a
        downcase
     
12. C-M-r   isearch-backward-regexp -- incremental regular expression search backwards
    C-M-s   isearch-forward-regexp -- incremental regular expression search
    C-M-t   transpose-sexps -- transpose expressions
    C-M-u   backward-up-list -- move up in structure of parenthesis
    C-M-v   scroll-other-window -- scroll next window upwards a specified number of lines
    I used the emacs command that displays the name and documentation of a specific key:
        C-h k KEY
    
13. C-g is keyboard quit, signaling a quit condition that directly causes quit during execution
    of Lisp program. The current command is cancelled and the user is brought back to edit mode.
    Commands used:
        C-h k C-g

14. "yank" reinserts, or pastes, the last stretch of killed text. 
    This is easily invoked with C-y
    Commands used:
        C-h t       to pull up the Emacs tutorial
        C-s yank    to search for "yank" and the shortcut, which is C-y
        C-h a yank  to find description of the yank command

15. From the emacs command 'C-x d /usr/bin', we find that the dired command outputs:
        total used in directory 297928 available 13074856
    From the shell command 'ls -l /usr/bin', we find that the ls -l command outputs:
        total 297852
    The difference between the two is that the dired command also prints out the available space.
