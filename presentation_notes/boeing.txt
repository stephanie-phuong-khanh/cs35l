Boeing Self Flying Plane
Nikhil Arora & Carol Lin

Successful test flight
* Jan 11 - successful self driving air taxi prototype - takeoff, hover, land
* Aurora Flight Sciences
* autonomous navigation and landing systems

Plane - quieter, better for environment
* 30 ft body
* 28 ft wingspan
* vertical rotors
* electric propulsion

How it works
* internal map of surroundings -- uber (64 laser beams and sensors) & google (lasers, radar, cameras, sonar)
* navigation system -- software processes inputs and plots a path -- insns sent to actuators to control acceleration, braking, steering
* traffic rules/obstacles -- hardcoded obstacle avoidance algos, predictive modeling, smart object discrimination (knowing dif between other cars, buses/trucks, bikes/motorcycles)
* partially-autonomous -- requires human intervention if system encounters uncertainty -- what most selfdriving cars have right now -- what boeing is rn
* fully autonomous -- vehicle in full control of system, may not even offer steerin wheel
* "connected" self-driving vehicles -- communicate w/ other vehicles or infrastructure (traffic lights) -- most prototypes lack this -- e.g. Boeing communicates w/ other air taxis

Applications
* self-flying commercial planes
* save airlines over $38 billion
* reduce passenger fares by 10%
* meet increasing demands for flights -- 6 fold increase in flights by 2050, actually lack of pilots right now

Uber Elevate/Air
* partnership w/ Uber -- commercial network of planes that provide service from tops of tall buildings
* autonomous flights across the city to avoid trafic
* increase mobility in cities, reduce congested roads, planned for 2023 (LA included!)

Safety impacts
* Pros
	- thousands die in motor vehicle crashes per year in US -> over 30k deaths in 2015
	- software less error-prone than humnans -- plane crashes normally caused by pilot error
* Cons
	- cybersecurity still issue

Equity impacts
* Pros
	- ppl who can't drive will benefit eg elderly, disabled
	- no public transport
* Cons
	- decrease work opportunity for employed drivers
	- less funding for public transport

Environment
* Pros
	- electric autonomous - drop in air pollution/climate impact - more shared rides
* Cons
	- gasoline-powered autonomous vehicles - increase in emissions and air pollution
