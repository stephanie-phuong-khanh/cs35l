Augmented Reality
Omar & Lauryn

History
* 1960s Harvard - Ivan Sutherland first AR prototypes
* NASA, AirForce, MIT, UNC researched in 70s and 80s
* Caudel and Mizell at Boeing coined - 1990
* Afterwards became research field

How tf it works
* trackers, sensors, cameras, computers, displays —> render environment
* modify input to human sight, sound, rely on touch for input to AR system
* 3 types
    * video see-through — video feed edited w/ extra info, fed to you through screen
    * optical see-through — goggles/google glass — transparent mirrors are sensors (projected on top)
    * projected display — projects AR onto real world examples
* most AR systems use goggles and headsets

Star Wars — Luke’s helmet — Hugh’s electronics

AR for Specialized Repairs in LA
* 105 fire stations in LA
* sent broken headsets to Piper Technical Center  :( 
* AR goggles let ppl fix own headsets  :)  faster, cheaper

Applications
* google glass — ugly, technological let down, creepy —> paid big bang actor to wear
* pokemon go — successful because of nostalgia

Limitations
* Resource intensive
    * VR easier to implement because you don’t have to interact with your environment
    * Mapping and constantly adapting to changing physical environment -> long time to design
* AR devices ugly and inconvenient, user on boarding cost outweighs gains
* Probably won’t be for mainstream use — rather for niche industries
