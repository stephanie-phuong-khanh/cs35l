Machine Learning
* large data set
* algos (neural networks, layers, parameters)
* predictions (recognition patterns to increase accuracy, recognize trends/patterns)

AI - computers do tasks w/ human intelligence
* classifying
* decision making
* speech recognition
* visual recognition
* language translation

Analyze solar panels on houses with ML
* Multilayered approach to make connections — modeled after neurons of human brain
    * Brain connecting to nodes (neurons) through edges
* data -> label -> cluster/classify
* inception

DeepSolar
1. static images - google maps — analyzed tiles (smaller than zip code, larger than neighborhood), over 1 billion
2. fed into convolutional neural network — inception model (already labeled images), high precision, classified 102,400 pixels per image
3. database — recognize 50% more solar panels, considered roof tilt and shape, commercial and residential (they look dif)
4. identify trends — income, weather, population, education level
5. solar forest — prediction

Results — 2 metrics
1. residential areas — 93% precision, 88.5% recall
2. nonresidential areas — 93.7% precision, 90.5% recall 
* precision = (true positive) / (true pos + false pos)
* recall =  (true positive) / (true pos + false neg)   ???

Insights
* commercial in midwest
* lots in CA, New England
* solar panels & population density — like a bell curve
* solar panels & income — level off at super high
* solar panels & education — positive correlation
* solar panels & income inequality — more inequality -> fewer solar panels bought

SolarForst
* predictive model using Random Forest
* can guess existence and number of solar panels
* 94 factors ranked by importance
* merges many trees together to make more accurate result
* adds randomness by searching in random subset of features
* e.g. want to guess major of students. Random forest — take ethnicity, socks, clubs, etc. —> take random subset of those features, choose best predictive method
* R - many parameters to refine algorithm

Applications
* solar panels -> energy companies, building managers
* farmland - city planning, urban design
* expand worldwide, identify utilities, identify garbage patches in ocean, find areas destroyed by forest fires, predict wildfire risk areas
