Issues with AI/Facial Recognition
* biased
* Microsoft's version had problems w/ tweetbot
* Amazon Rekognition
	* government agencies like Washington County Sheriff's office in Oregon using it despite known drawbacks
	* mistook 28 members of Congress as mugshots (40% are POC) -> AI would be biased against ppl of color

IBM's work
* problem with data given to facial recognition -> need more diverse
* Diversity if Faces -- data set of annotations of 1 million publicly available face images
* coding schemes
	* craniofacial distances = vertical distances between elements in a face
	* craniofacial areas - measurements of dif areas of face
	* ...?
	* facial symmetry - ratio
	* facial region contrast
	* skin color w/ Individual Typology Angle
	* age prediction -> predict age
	* gender prediction
	* subjective annotation
	* pose and resolution - DLIB ml algo

Statistical Analysis
* biodiversity studied w/ number of species present, relative abundance/evenness
* --> hope to accelerate study of diversity and coverage for AI
* ten dif coding schemes expanded
* new dataset better for reducing model bias?
