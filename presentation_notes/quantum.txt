Quantum Mech
* energy and subatomic particles
* contrast from classical physics - not bound by discrete values
* probabilities to describe state of particles i.e. electrons
* energy

Properties
* superposition  - quantum states added (waves)
* entanglement - groups of particles describe each others' spin, position, momentum, polarization; separated by large distance; measuring any quantum state has effect of changing a particle's state

Quantum computers
* will not help us to do regular hardware/software task
* expensive af - won't replace normal computers - super complex - solve different complicated problems
* very fast - thousands of times faster than conventional computer
* search thru and process huge amounts of data - like finding needle in haystack
* examined 1 trillion possible moves per second during chess game - regular does 200M/second
* virtual experiments - predict outcome w/o creating unusual conditions in lab -- e.g. recreating chemical reactions

Benefits
* redefine cyber security -- speed of quantum computers creates changes in field of cryptography and encryption - critical/complex cyber security problems
* alternate realities (maybe) -- multiverse (problem can have infinite or many probably solutions) -- perform 'n' tasks in 'n' parallel universes
* quantum realm (?)
* better power efficiency
