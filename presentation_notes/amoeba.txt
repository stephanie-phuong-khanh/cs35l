Amoeba & Traveling Salesman
Eric & ?
* Amoeba - smol lil shit - can expand as one entity like elastic woman
* Agar - like algae
* NP Hard - holy fuk
* Optimization - best way to solve

Traveling Salesman - figure out optimal path that will take salesman to all cities and take him back home in shortest distance
* reward - visiting each city
* cost - distance traveled

Experiment
* 2011 Keio in Tokyo - amoeba to solve
* reward is placing agar
* cost - focusing dif amounts of light -> amoeba hates this 
* can't double back - return to node already visited

Results
* regardless of complexity, amoeba's solution remained high quality -> linar time complexity
* shortest path corresponds to the most stable configuration because amoeba choose to go ways with less light and get as much nutrients as possible - intrinsic properties
* solved in new unique way than computers
* amobea constantly testing new body shapres at a constant rate and processed optical feedback at same time -- something computers can learn!!!

Before - there was experiment on slime molds

Future
* Math problems - constraint satisfaction, boolean satisfiability problems
* Traffic flow - intelligent behavior of simple organisms give insight to "swarm intelligence" - seemingly intelligent, emergent behavior of swarm-like slime molds
	- traffic - many independent cars that need to cooperate to maximize network performance
* Biological computers - living things actually better for optimization - e.g. slime mold
* Amoebe inspired parallel computing -- mimics amoeba's photo-feedback mechanism wich charge dynamics in capacitors - expand in one place, contract in the other to achieve best configuration
