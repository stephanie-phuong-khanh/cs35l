LiDar
* light detection
* remote sensing method
* light shined on surface -> collect data about surface
* laser emitter, scanner, gps to get info

Gymnastics
* judges' eyes on form, body posture
* Fujitsu came up w/ system of LiDar to assest form, difficulty, executiong using LiDar
* scan 3D for form

How it works
* emits laser pulses on surface
* catches reflected laser back to LiDAR pulse source
* measure time laser travelled
* 3d mapping

Applications
* environment -- coastal erosion, pollution, forest fires, etc -> accurate maps, prevention efforts
	* topographic, bathymetric (water-penetrating green light)
	* search and rescue
* sports - behavioral analysis, scoring
