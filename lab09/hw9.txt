2.  Checkout diffutiles onto branch "quote" (branch from master)
    $   git checkout v3.0 -b quote

3.  Apply patch, having patch in same parent director as the diffutils folder.
    I ran this command inside the diffutils folder.
    $   patch -p1 < ../quote-3.0-patch.txt
    patching file src/cmp.c
    patching file src/diff.c
    patching file src/diff3.c
    patching file src/dir.c
    patching file src/sdiff.c
    patching file src/util.c

4.  add-change-log-entry-other-window:  C-x 4 a

5.  Created changelog and pasted info for each function changed by our patch:
    $   emacs
    $   C-x 4 a

    * src/cmp.c (try_help, specify_ignore_initial, usage, main):
    * src/diff.c (main, try_help, option_help_msgid, specify_value)
    (compare_files):
    * src/diff3.c (main, try_help, option_help_msgid, usage)
    (read_diff):
    * src/dir.c (compare_names):
    * src/sdiff.c (try_help, usage, check_child_status, main):
    * src/util.c (finish_output):
    Quote 'like this' in output.

    Write ChangeLog to directory and exited Emacs:
    $   C-x C-s
    $   C-x C-c

6.  Commit changes to new branch:
    $   git add .
    $   git commit -F ChangeLog

7.  Generate formatted-patch.txt:
    $   git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

8.  For this section I worked with Eric Chen. I uploaded his patch (which I named
    eric-patch.txt) to the server and applied the patch in new 'eric' branch I created
    by branching from master.
    $   git checkout v3.0 -b eric
    $   git am eric-patch.txt

    Check it works by rebuilding with same patch linked in the spec:
    $   ./bootstrap
    $   patch -p0 < diffutils-gets.diff
    $   ./configure
    $   make
    $   make check

    I perform the same tests as we did in lab:
    $   ./src/diff . -
    ./src/diff: cannot compare '-' to a directory
    This is correct because there are two ' instead of `-' like before.

    $   ./src/diff --help | grep "[\`]"
    No output, so no backticks found.

    Eric's patch works, and mine works when he tests on his server.

9.  Check that ChangeLog entry works:
    $   make distdir
    This creates the folder diffutils-3.0.1-0bde6 in which I examine the ChangeLog
    to see that the first commit is Eric's:
    $   emacs diffutils-3.0.1-0bde6/ChangeLog

10. Emacs repository:
    Exited server, ssh again with -Y flag to allow trusted X11 forwarding. Inside the
    emacs repository, run gitk:
    $   ssh -Y classste@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu 
    $   cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
    $   gitk

    The window in XQuartz opened up and I scrolled and found the earliest commit no
    newer than 2015-01-25 and screenshotted:
